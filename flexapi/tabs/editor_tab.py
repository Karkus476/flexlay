        This function should return an integer indicating how effective this class is at editing these items.
        Not sure? Return 5 if can edit, and 0 if cannot.
        Quick Outline:
        0: Unable to edit, or subclasses should not be allowed to edit.
        1: Return by default if this is an abstract class, and checks succeed
        2 - 4: Return if not abstract class, and can edit
        5 - 7: Provides some specific features, subclasses may be made.
        8 - 10: Very specific to this resource, file type or data type
        Abstract base classes should return 1 by default and only return 0 if subclasses should not be allowed to
        edit.
        A super call can then be used to easily perform some checks.
